            We build frameworks that ensure artificial intelligence remains safe, transparent, and profoundly human. Our work lives where brilliance meets responsibility: a shared space of research, ethics, and vision.

            Specialized evaluation for AI systems making suicide risk assessments, crisis decisions, and psychiatric determinations. When failures could harm or kill someone, we identify risks before they generate lawsuits, regulatory action, or deaths.

        <h2 class="editorial-headline fade-in-up">Why We Exist</h2>
        <p class="editorial-body fade-in-up">
            The Lono Collective was founded on the belief that mental health AI safety evaluation requires more than technical expertise. It demands clinical knowledge, regulatory understanding, and unwavering commitment to independent, rigorous research.
        </p>
        <p class="editorial-body fade-in-up">
             We believe that high-stakes work demands a high level of personal investment, and that the traditional corporate model is a poor match for the level of ownership required of the people building our future. Every contributing full member therefore is granted their well-earned equal ownership in the Lono Collective.
        </p>
        <p class="editorial-body fade-in-up">
            As a worker-owned cooperative, we're structured to prioritize honest findings over profit. No venture capital pressure. No equity stakes in the companies we evaluate. No compromised research integrity. Just systematic, evidence-based evaluation of AI systems where failures can cause real harm.
        </p>

<section class="mission-approach">
    <div class="mission-content">
        <h2 class="editorial-headline fade-in-up">Our Approach</h2>
        <p class="editorial-body fade-in-up">
            We combine board-certified clinical expertise with academic research methodology to identify failure modes before they harm patients. Our evaluation frameworks are grounded in evidence-based clinical tools like the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), validated through systematic review processes (PRISMA), and informed by expert consensus methods (Delphi).
        </p>
        <p class="editorial-body fade-in-up">
            Mental health AI operates in contexts where ambiguity is the norm, incomplete information is expected, and judgment calls determine whether someone lives or dies. Generic AI safety evaluation misses what matters in these high-stakes clinical environments. We test for what actually breaks in crisis situations, because lives depend on getting it right.
