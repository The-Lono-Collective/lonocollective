            We build frameworks that ensure artificial intelligence remains safe, transparent, and profoundly human. Our work lives where brilliance meets responsibility: a shared space of research, ethics, and vision.

            Specialized evaluation for consumer-facing chatbots in high-stakes domains: healthcare, companion bots, legal advice, financial guidance, and customer service. When failures could harm users or create liability, we identify risks before they generate lawsuits, regulatory action, or worse.

        <h2 class="editorial-headline fade-in-up">Why We Exist</h2>
        <p class="editorial-body fade-in-up">
            The Lono Collective was founded on the belief that chatbot safety evaluation requires more than technical expertise. It demands domain knowledge, regulatory understanding, and unwavering commitment to independent, rigorous research.
        </p>
        <p class="editorial-body fade-in-up">
             We believe that high-stakes work demands a high level of personal investment, and that the traditional corporate model is a poor match for the level of ownership required of the people building our future. Every contributing full member therefore is granted their well-earned equal ownership in the Lono Collective.
        </p>
        <p class="editorial-body fade-in-up">
            As a worker-owned cooperative, we're structured to prioritize honest findings over profit. No venture capital pressure. No equity stakes in the companies we evaluate. No compromised research integrity. Just systematic, evidence-based evaluation of AI systems where failures can cause real harm.
        </p>

<section class="mission-approach">
    <div class="mission-content">
        <h2 class="editorial-headline fade-in-up">Our Approach</h2>
        <p class="editorial-body fade-in-up">
            We combine domain expertise with academic research methodology to identify failure modes before they harm users or create liability. Our evaluation frameworks are grounded in rigorous testing protocols, validated through systematic review processes, and informed by expert consensus methods.
        </p>
        <p class="editorial-body fade-in-up">
            Consumer-facing chatbots operate in contexts where ambiguity is the norm, incomplete information is expected, and judgment calls can determine whether someone is helped or harmed. Generic AI safety evaluation misses what matters in these high-stakes environments. We test for what actually breaks when real users interact with your system.
