## Consolidation Candidates

### Option A: Merge Statistics into Failure Mode Alert
The statistics reinforce the failure mode message. Could combine into single "The Stakes" section.

### Option B: Move Regulatory Tracker to separate page
Already have `/regulations/` page. Homepage could show 2-3 highlights with "View All" link.

### Option C: Combine Framework + Case Studies
Both explain the evaluation methodology. Could present as "How We're Different" with examples inline.

## Recommendation
Start with Option B (regulatory tracker) as it's the most straightforward change with clear UX benefit. The scrolling marquee is visually busy and duplicates content available on dedicated page.

## Action Required
- [ ] Review with stakeholder
- [ ] Decide on consolidation approach
- [ ] Create follow-up implementation plan if approved
